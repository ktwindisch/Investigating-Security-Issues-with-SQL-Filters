<h1>Investigating Security Issues with SQL Filters</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

I am a security professional at a large organization. As part of my job, I investigate security issues to help keep our system secure. Recently, I discovered some potential security issues involving login attempts and employee machines.
My task is to examine the organization's data in the employees and log_in_attempts tables. I will use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

<h2>Environments Used:</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Investigation walk-through:</h2>

<h4> Summary:  </h4>

I retrieved the following data:<br/>
<ul>
<li>After-hours login attempts: I retrieved all login attempts that were made outside of normal business hours.</li>
<li>Login attempts on specific dates: I retrieved all login attempts that were made on specific dates that I was interested in.</li>
<li>Login attempts outside of Mexico: I retrieved all login attempts that were made from outside of Mexico.</li>
<li>Employee data from the marketing, finance, and sales departments: I retrieved employee data from these departments for investigation purposes.</li>
<li>Employees who were part of all other remaining departments that were not in the information technology department: I retrieved employee data from all departments that were not in the information technology department.</li></ul>

This data helped me to identify the potential security issues and to take steps to mitigate the risks.<br/>

Here are some of the security issues that I identified:<br/>
<ul>
<li>There were a number of after-hours login attempts. This could be a sign that someone was trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.</li>
<li>There were a number of login attempts on specific dates. This could be a sign that someone was trying to access the system at a time when they knew the system would be less secure.</li>
<li>There were a number of login attempts from outside of Mexico. This could be a sign that someone was trying to access the system from a foreign country.</li>
<li>There were a number of employees in the marketing, finance, and sales departments who had made suspicious login attempts.</li>
<li>There were a number of employees in departments other than the information technology department who had made suspicious login attempts.</li>
</ul>

As a security professional at a large organization, I recently discovered some potential security issues involving login attempts and employee machines. I used SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets to investigate these issues.
SQL can be used to achieve a better security posture by helping to identify and prevent security threats. By using these queries, businesses can gain valuable insights into their security posture and take steps to mitigate risks.
